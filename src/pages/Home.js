          My name is Brian Hobby and I'm an aspiring Javascript junior engineer
          looking to break into the field for the first time! I started my
          journey in October of 2021 and have worked in many different
          programming environments since. Programming for me initially started
          out as a career change that would utilize my talents in the
          technosphere, giving me a better quality of work and life. Halfway
          into my journey I quickly discovered a different perspective, it
          became a passion. I found myself developing a sense of pride every
          time I overcame a new obstacle and added more knowledge and ability in
          my chosen field. Then I began to share that passion and excitement
          with my friends, family, and soon fellow aspiring developers which
          opened an entirely new world of possibilities and perspective. I hope
          to eventually find a career with others that share this passion and
          excitement in order to help build something truly wonderful.
